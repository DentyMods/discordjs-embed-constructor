## Really simple info about Discord.js embeds

##### Everyone has their own way of doing stuff, So dont bitch about me doing something that isn't in your "omg this is how you do it!!!" list.


### How to start off the embed.

#### Obviously you will need to define the embed to be used in a message when a certain event is triggred, For this we will act like we are creating a embed command. Also we will be defining this as a constant.

```javascript
const embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
```

### Next is the fun part.
###### Some of this was pulled from https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageEmbed
